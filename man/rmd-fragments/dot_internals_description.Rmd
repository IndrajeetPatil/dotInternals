The goal of `{dotInternals}` is to set apart names of internal functions from the ones exported by adding a dot (`.`) in front of their name. The package automates this task in a scalable manner, and can be a nifty tool for large legacy projects with tons of internal functions.

Having a separate naming pattern for exported versus non-exported functions brings clarity to both users and developers about the public API of the package.
