Here is how functions will be renamed depending on whether they are exported or not:

- For **exported functions**, names will not be changed:

```r
# before        ---> after
extract_value() ---> extract_value() 
.draw_graph()   ---> .draw_graph()
```

- For **non-exported functions**, names will be prepended with a `.`, but only if it isn't already named that way:

```r
# before        ---> after
extract_value() ---> .extract_value() 
.draw_graph()   ---> .draw_graph()
```

There is an exception to this rule: `S3`/`S4` methods will not be renamed, even if it is not exported.

```r
# before        ---> after
str.my_class()  ---> str.my_class() 
```

A few important things to keep in mind:

  - You need to run this function in the **package root directory**. 
  
  - The package needs to be **installed**, rather than just sourced. 
  
  - If you have run `dot_internals()` once and wish to run it again, you need to build the package before doing so.
  
  - The function will not work if you have run   `devtools::load_all()`/`pkgload::load_all()`.
  
  - There is also RStudio addin that you can use.
