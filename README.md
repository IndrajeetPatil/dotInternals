The goal of `{dotInternals}` is to set apart names of internal functions
from the ones exported by adding a dot (`.`) in front of their name. The
package automates this task in a scalable manner, and can be a nifty
tool for large legacy projects with tons of internal functions.

Having a separate naming pattern for exported versus non-exported
functions brings clarity to both users and developers about the public
API of the package.

You need to run this function in the **package root directory**. There
is also RStudio addin that you can use.

**Note**: This will not work if you have already run
`devtools::load_all()`/`pkgload::load_all()`.

Here is how functions will be renamed depending on whether they are
exported or not:

- For **exported functions**, names will not be changed:

``` r
# before        ---> after
extract_value() ---> extract_value() 
.draw_graph()   ---> .draw_graph()
```

- For **non-exported functions**, names will be prepended with a `.`,
  but only if it isnâ€™t already named that way:

``` r
# before        ---> after
extract_value() ---> .extract_value() 
.draw_graph()   ---> .draw_graph()
```

There is an exception to this rule: `S3`/`S4` methods will not be
renamed, even if it is not exported.

``` r
# before        ---> after
str.my_class()  ---> str.my_class() 
```
